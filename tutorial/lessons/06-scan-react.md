## 06 - Scan

In the previous lesson, [05 - Stream](05-stream-react.html), we learned about streams and
wrote a simple implementation with a `map` method. Using a stream for `update`, we were able
to have a better separation between a way for the view to issue updates, and the functions
that use these updates to change the model and re-render the view.

Recall that our Meiosis pattern setup code was:

```js
var model = 0;
var update = stream();
var view = createView(update);

var element = document.getElementById("app");

update.map(function(value) {
  model = model + value;
  ReactDOM.render(view(model), element)
});

ReactDOM.render(view(model), element);
```

- We have an **initial model** of 0.
- We render the view with that initial model (on the last line).
- When an update comes in, our function gets called to:
  - Update the model, and
  - Re-render the view.

Notice that when we update the model, `model = model + value`, we are **combining** the incoming
value with the current model (here, by addition), and the result becomes the current model for
next time. Let's call this an **accumulator**.

### Introducing `scan`

It turns out that streams have, besides `map`, another method called `scan`. In fact, stream
libraries have a number of other methods (also called operators), ranging from a handful to an
overwhelming amount! But, we **only** need `map` and `scan`. Furthermore, we only need to use
them in **one place** - the Meiosis pattern setup code.

Like `map`, `scan` takes a source stream and produces a new stream. Remember that with `map`,
whenever a new value arrives on the source stream, the function that we passed to `map` gets
called, and the result is the next value on the new stream.

With `scan`, instead of passing a function of one parameter, we pass a function of **two**
parameters. This function is called an **accumulator**.

When a new value arrives on the source stream, the accumulator function gets called with the
**latest** result that we returned, and the incoming value from the source stream. The result that
we return from the accumulator function is the next value on the new stream, **and** it also
becomes the **latest** result.

Finally, since at first there is no latest result, we pass to `scan` an **initial value**, which
becomes starting point for the latest result, and the first value on the new stream.

Let's look at an example. Say we start with an `update` stream:

```js
var update = stream();
```

Next, we create an `otherStream` with `scan`:

```js
var otherStream = scan(function(latest, next) {
  return latest + next;
}, 0, update);
```

As you can see, we need to pass three parameters to `scan`:

- The accumulator function. Here, the function adds the next value coming in from `update` to the
latest value.
- The initial value, `0`. So, `otherStream` will start with a value of `0`.
- The source stream, `update`.

If we call `update(5)`, the next value on `otherStream` will be `0 + 5 = 5`. If we then call
`update(-3)`, now the latest value is `5`, the next value is `-3`, and the result is `5 + -3 = 2`.
The sequence continues, always adding the incoming value to the latest result, as illustrated
below:

As you can certainly guess, this will fit in nicely for our Meiosis pattern setup code.

### Implementing `scan`

To implement `scan`, first we'll improve our `stream` by adding a feature: optionally passing
in an initial value for the stream:

```js
var stream = function(initial) {
  var mapFunctions = [];
  var createdStream = function(value) {
    for (var i in mapFunctions) {
      mapFunctions[i](value);
    }
  };
  createdStream.map = function(mapFunction) {
    var newInitial = undefined;
    if (initial !== undefined) {
      newInitial = mapFunction(initial);
    }
    var newStream = stream(newInitial);

    mapFunctions.push(function(value) {
      newStream(mapFunction(value));
    });

    return newStream;
  };
  return createdStream;
};
```

We've added the `initial` parameter. Then, when `map` is called, we check whether there was an
initial value for the source stream. If there was, then the initial value for the new stream
is the result of calling the passed in `mapFunction`.

Now that we can specify an initial value for a stream, we can implement `scan`:

```js
var scan = function(accumulator, initial, sourceStream) {
  var newStream = stream(initial);
  var accumulated = initial;

  sourceStream.map(function(value) {
    accumulated = accumulator(accumulated, value);
    newStream(accumulated);
  });

  return newStream;
};
```

As we discussed, `scan` takes an accumulator function, an initial value, and a source stream.
The new stream starts with the initial value. This is also the starting point for the
`accumulated` value, which is the latest result. Then, we `map` on the source stream, passing in
a function that takes the incoming value, calls the `accumulator` function with the latest
`accumulated` value and the incoming value, and pushes the result onto the new stream.

### Putting it all together

Now that we have `scan`, we can improve our Meiosis pattern setup code. Previously, we had:

```js
var model = 0;
var update = stream();
var view = createView(update);

var element = document.getElementById("app");

update.map(function(value) {
  model = model + value;
  ReactDOM.render(view(model), element)
});

ReactDOM.render(view(model), element)
```

We can make these improvements:

- No longer have a `model` variable that we keep reassigning. Instead, our accumulator function
can be cleaner and more self-contained: it can receive the latest model and the next value, and
return the result. It will not refer to variables that are on the outside.
- The initial value can simply be passed to `scan`.
- The result of `scan` is a stream of models. We can `map` on that and re-render the view every
time we have a new model value on the stream.
- Since `scan` produces the initial value on the resulting stream, we no longer have to call
`ReactDOM.render` initially (this was done at the bottom of our previous setup code). Instead, we
have the initial model on the `models` stream, and the function that we pass to `map` will get
called to render the initial view.

Here are our changes:

```js
var update = stream();
var view = createView(update);

var models = scan(function(model, value) {
  return model + value;
}, 0, update);

var element = document.getElementById("app");

models.map(function(model) {
  ReactDOM.render(view(model), element)
});
```

You can try out the complete example below.

### Exercise

In our example, both the `model` and the values coming in on the `update` stream are numbers.
However, `scan` also works with values of different types.

Keep the `model` as a number, but change the values that are sent on `update` to be objects of the
form `{ oper: "add", value: 1 }`. Use this for the `+1` button.

Change the `-1` button's label to `*2`, and have its `onclick` function call
`update({ oper: "times", value: 2 })`.

Finally, change the accumulator function that is passed to `scan` so that it looks at the object's
`oper` and `value`, and performs the operation on the model accordingly and returns the result.
