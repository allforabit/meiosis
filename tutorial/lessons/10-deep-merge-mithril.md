## 10 - Deep Merge

In the previous lesson, [09 - Nesting](09-nesting-mithril.html), we looked at how we could
**nest** the `update` function so that we could have multiple instances of the temperature
element, each at its own path within the top-level model. The temperature code did not need
to change, it continued to work with just its own subset of the model.

As a first way of signaling nested updates, we used objects shaped as `{ path: ..., data: ... }`
to indicate the path at which to update the model. In this lesson, we'll use a different approach.

### Let's try going back to `Object.assign`

Instead of sending updates as `{ path: ..., data: ... }`, let's try going back to using
`Object.assign`. Remember, in that case we just sent data objects as updates, and merged them in
with `Object.assign`. At the time, we weren't nesting, so our top-level model was:

```js
{ value: 22, units: "C" }
```

We were sending updates such a `{ value: 23 }`.

Now, our top-level model is:

```js
{ air:   { value: 22, units: "C" },
  water: { value: 84, units: "F" }
}
```

So we need to send updates such as:

```js
{ air: { value: 23 } }
```

We then hope to merge that in with the top-level model to obtain:

```js
{ air:   { value: 23, units: "C" },
  water: { value: 84, units: "F" }
}
```

### Nesting with plain data objects

Whereas before we were "tagging" our updates with a `path` property, nesting with plain data
objects is just a matter of placing the incoming data within the object using the path:

```js
var nest = function(update, prop) {
  return function(obj) {
    var result = {};
    result[prop] = obj;
    update(result);
  };
};
```

Again we are wrapping `update` with `nest`. Now, when the temperature code calls
`update({ value: 23 })`, if we nest the temperature element with `nest(update, "air")`, the
update will be transformed into `{ air: { value: 23 } }`.

We can then try to merge in the update using `Object.assign` as our accumulator function:

```js
var models = m.stream.scan(Object.assign,
  { air:   { value: 22, units: "C" },
    water: { value: 84, units: "F" }
  },
  update);
```

But this doesn't work. Try it out below. Can you see what is not quite working? Do you have an
idea why?

Above, changing units works at first, but increasing or decreasing the temperature causes us to
lose the units. What's happening?

### Deep Merge

The problem is that `Object.assign` does a **shallow** merge: it only merges properties at the
first level. Nested properties from the source **overwrite** the nested properties in the target:

```js
Object.assign(
  { air:   { value: 22, units: "C" },
    water: { value: 84, units: "F" }
  },
  { air:   { value: 23 }
  }
);
// Result is:
  { air:   { value: 23 },
    water: { value: 84, units: "F" }
  },
```

As you can see above, at the first level we have `air` and `water`, so `Object.assign` merges
`air` and keeps `water`. But after that, whatever is under `air` overwrites whatever was there
previously. So `{ value: 23 }` entirely replaces `{ value: 22, units: "C" }` and we lose `units`.

What we need is a **deep** merge, so that properties at every level are merged together.

There are several options for deep merge support. One of them is [Lodash](http://lodash.com),
which provides [_.merge](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5#merge). Another is
[deepmerge](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/deepmerge), which is a tiny library dedicated to
provide deep merge support.

Before we do that, though, let's talk about **multiple** levels of nesting.

### Multiple Levels of Nesting

Now that we'll be passing plain objects via `update` and merging them into the model, we can use
more than one level of nesting.

What I mean by that is, we can nest temperatures at `air` and `water`, but then we can create
another element, `temperaturePair`, which contains the `air` and `water` temperatures. Then, we
can in turn nest `temperaturePair` at `temperatures`.

Our top-level model is now:

```js
{ temperatures:
  { air:   { value: 22, units: "C" },
    water: { value: 84, units: "F" }
  }
}
```

The following illustrates multiple levels of nesting. `createTemperaturePair` nests
`createTemperature` at `air` and `water`. `createView` in turn nests `createTemperaturePair`  at
`temperatures`.

![Multiple nesting](10-deep-merge-02.svg)

Multiple levels of nesting means that we can use and re-use elements at various points within our
top-level model. The code for these elements does not need to change, and is blissfully unaware of
where they are nested within the top-level model. They can happily continue to work with just their
model.

This also enables us to have elements that use properties like `value` in their model, without
conflicting with other elements that also use `value`. Each element has its separate place within
the top-level model. We can compose elements out of other elements, and compose _those_ elements
into other elements, and so on.

Let's put everything together. You can see how we have multiple levels of nesting. As previously
discussed, we're using Lodash's `_.merge` to achieve deep merging of updates into the model.

### Exercise

- Add another element next to `temperatures` so that your top-level model is
`{ temperatures: ..., other: ... }`, of course replacing `other` with your choice of property name.
The element that you add should not "know" where it is nested within the top-level model. For bonus
points, add another element that is nested within the element that you added.

When you are ready, continue on to [11 - Components](11-components-mithril.html).
