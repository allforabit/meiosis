<h2>00 - Introduction</h2><p>Welcome to the <a href="http://meiosis.js.org">Meiosis</a> Tutorial!</p>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to explain the Meiosis pattern from the ground up, hopefully
without assuming too much prior knowledge beyond the basics of JavaScript.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>Besides JavaScript, you will need to know, or learn, about the view library that you would
like to use. This tutorial is offered in two versions: one with
<a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a>, and one with <a href="http://mithril.js.org">Mithril</a>.</p>
<h3>View Libraries</h3><p>If neither of those is your preferred view library, fear not! It is trivial to use just about
any view library with the Meiosis pattern, whether it&#39;s a virtual DOM library or even
libraries such as <a href="http://meiosis.js.org/examples/setup/lit-html/index.html">lit-html</a>
and <a href="http://meiosis.js.org/examples/setup/hyperHTML/index.html">hyperHTML</a>.</p>
<h3>JSX or hyperscript</h3><p>Also note that if you prefer the <a href="https://infernojs.org/docs/guides/what-is-jsx">JSX</a> syntax,
you should read the React version. Again, it is simple to use another view library, such as
<a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a>, <a href="https://infernojs.org/">Inferno</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>If you prefer the <a href="https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript">hyperscript</a> syntax, please read
the Mithril version of the tutorial. Other view libraries such as
<a href="https://github.com/paldepind/snabbdom">snabbdom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/leeoniya/domvm">domVM</a>,
and other hyperscript view libraries are also easy to use with Meiosis.</p>
<h3>ES5 or ES6</h3><p>I purposely used ES5 syntax in the code examples so that readers who are not familiar with ES6
could benefit from the tutorial, without requiring ES6 knowledge. If you prefer ES6, by all means
go ahead and use it! It can certainly lead to more concise syntax in some cases.</p>
<h3>Embedded Code Examples</h3><p>The best way to learn is to practice! So, all code examples for this tutorial are embedded
into the page using <a href="https://github.com/porsager/flems">Flems</a>, so that you can edit the
code and see the results right there in the page. In fact, I strongly encourage you to try
things out with the code, this will help you understand how things work.</p>
<p>You can edit and run the code within the page, or you can also open the code in a new,
full-sized page if that is more comfortable. You can do so using the
<img src="flems-open-in-new-window.png" alt="Open Flems in new window"> at the top-right corner of the
code window.</p>
<p>Finally, also note that you can also download and run the code examples for this tutorial,
as well as <em>all</em> the Meiosis examples, by cloning the
<a href="https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis-examples">github repository</a>.</p>
