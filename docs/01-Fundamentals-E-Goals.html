<h2>Meiosis Goals</h2><p>What are we trying to achieve?</p>
<p>We want to manage the data flow of our web applications with these principles:</p>
<p><em>Single Source of Truth</em>: we have a single root model to represent the state of the application
at any point in time.</p>
<p><em>View as a function</em>: we render the UI using a function of the model and some callbacks to signal
updates.</p>
<p><em>Fractal architecture</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fractal architecture is possible, but not required.</li>
<li>We can build the UI with a tree components.</li>
<li>Each component may use other components.</li>
<li>The top component is no different from the other components.</li>
<li>Components may be reused in multiple parts of the component tree.</li>
<li>The glue code that assembles everything together is separate from the top-level component.</li>
</ul>
<p>More about fractal architecture
<a href="http://antontelesh.github.io/architecture/2016/03/16/fractal-architecture.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Simple and scalable</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code can be broken up or kept together depending on the complexity of the application.</li>
<li>We can separate component code out into well-defined sections that each have a specific
responsibility (model, updates, actions, views, etc.)</li>
<li>We can choose to keep all the component code together if the application is simple,
or even as a matter of preference.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Nested components</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>While we have a single root model, components may be nested within certain paths of the model
and only be concerned with their own model.</li>
<li>Since components do not depend on the nested path where they reside within the top-level model,
they can be moved around without changes to the component itself.</li>
<li>The parent component controls how the child component is nested. In turn, a parent component may
be controlled by <em>its</em> parent component.</li>
<li>A child component is not tied to its parent component. Instead, it is given callback functions
to signal updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Controlled model updates</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Components signal updates by pushing model-changing functions onto a stream.</li>
<li>Thus, the top-level code is always aware of model updates. It automatically re-renders the view
after each model update.</li>
<li>The [ initial model ] &rarr; [ render view ] &rarr; [ model update ] &rarr;
[ re-render view ] is the reactive loop of our application.</li>
</ul>
