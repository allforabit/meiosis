## app

Application object.

Type: [Object][18]

### Properties

-   `Initial` **[Function][19]?**  a function that creates the initial state.
    This function can return a result or a `Promise`. If not specified, the initial state will
    be `{}`.
-   `Actions` **[Function][19]?** a function that creates actions, of the form
    `update => actions`.
-   `acceptors` **[Array][20]&lt;[Function][19]>?** an array of acceptor functions, each of which
    should be `state => patch`.
-   `services` **[Array][20]&lt;[Function][19]>?** an array of service functions, each of which
    should be `({ state, update, actions }) => void`.

## meiosis.common.setup

Base helper to setup the Meiosis pattern. If you are using Patchinko, Function Patches,
or Immer, use their respective `setup` function instead.

### Parameters

-   `stream` **StreamLib** the stream library. This works with `meiosis.simpleStream`, `flyd`,
    `m.stream`, or anything for which you provide either a function or an object with a `stream`
    function to create a stream. The function or object must also have a `scan` property.
    The returned stream must have a `map` method.
-   `accumulator` **[Function][19]** the accumulator function.
-   `combine` **[Function][19]** the function that combines patches into one.
-   `app` **[app][21]** the app, with optional properties.

Returns **[Promise][22]** a Promise that resolves to `{ update, models, states, actions }`
all of which are streams, except for `actions` which is the created actions.

## meiosis.patchinko.setup

Helper to setup the Meiosis pattern.

### Parameters

-   `stream` **StreamLib** the stream library. This works with `meiosis.simpleStream`, `flyd`,
    `m.stream`, or anything for which you provide either a function or an object with a `stream`
    function to create a stream. The function or object must also have a `scan` property.
    The returned stream must have a `map` method.
-   `O` **[Function][19]** the Patchinko function.
-   `app` **[app][21]** the app, with optional properties.

Returns **[Promise][22]** a Promise that resolves to `{ update, models, states, actions }`
all of which are streams, except for `actions` which is the created actions.

## meiosis.functionPatches.setup

Helper to setup the Meiosis pattern.

### Parameters

-   `stream` **StreamLib** the stream library. This works with `meiosis.simpleStream`, `flyd`,
    `m.stream`, or anything for which you provide either a function or an object with a `stream`
    function to create a stream. The function or object must also have a `scan` property.
    The returned stream must have a `map` method.
-   `app` **[app][21]** the app, with optional properties.

Returns **[Promise][22]** a Promise that resolves to `{ update, models, states, actions }`
all of which are streams, except for `actions` which is the created actions.

## meiosis.immer.setup

Helper to setup the Meiosis pattern.

### Parameters

-   `stream` **StreamLib** the stream library. This works with `meiosis.simpleStream`, `flyd`,
    `m.stream`, or anything for which you provide either a function or an object with a `stream`
    function to create a stream. The function or object must also have a `scan` property.
    The returned stream must have a `map` method.
-   `produce` **[Function][19]** the Immer `produce` function.
-   `app` **[app][21]** the app, with optional properties.

Returns **[Promise][22]** a Promise that resolves to `{ update, models, states, actions }`
all of which are streams, except for `actions` which is the created actions.

## simpleStream

A simple stream.

Type: [Function][19]

### Parameters

-   `value` **any?** emits a value onto the stream. When not specified, returns the
    stream's latest value.

### Properties

-   `map` **[Function][19]** creates a new stream for which the values from the original stream
    are processed by the passed-in function and emitted onto the new stream.

## meiosis.simpleStream.stream

Creates a stream.

### Parameters

-   `initial` **any?** the stream's initial value.

Returns **[simpleStream][23]** the created stream.

## meiosis.simpleStream.scan

Creates a new stream that starts with the initial value and, for each value arriving onto
the source stream, emits the result of calling the accumulator function with the latest
result and the source stream value.

### Parameters

-   `accumulator` **[Function][19]** a two-parameter function, the result of which is emitted
    onto the returned stream.
-   `initial` **any** the initial value for the returned stream.
-   `sourceStream` **[simpleStream][23]** the source stream from which values are processed by the
    accumulator function.

Returns **[simpleStream][23]** the created stream.
